# Deep Learning Tutorial at the 6th EIROforum school on Instrumentation


This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the hands-on tutorial for the Artificial Inteligence session at the 6th EIROforum school on Instrumentation.

See the [[https://indico.cern.ch/event/777129/timetable/#20190516.detailed][agenda page]]

You you want to run from SWAN you can open directly a notebook in SWAN from github.
Otherwise you can do:

1. Open a Terminal in SWAN
2. Clone your repository (it will appear in your cernbox folder)
```
git clone  https://github.com/lmoneta/ml-tutorial-EIROforum
```
* The notebooks will be in the directory *ml-tutorial-EIROforum* in your cernbox. 


## Swan and Jupyter notebooks quick start ##

If you have never used jupyter notebooks, you can find some quickstart information at the following links [What is a jupyter notebook?](http://nbvie\
wer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb), [Notebook Basics](htt\
p://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb),  [Running Code](http://nbviewer\
.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb).

For information on using SWAN, see the SWAN website: https://swan.web.cern.ch
In a nutshell, "SWAN (Service for Web based ANalysis) is a platform to perform interactive data analysis in the cloud". It gives you access to the L\
CG software stacks and to your CERNBOX files.

* You need to have an active **CERNBOX** to use swan (https://cernbox.cern.ch/). If you don't have a CERN account, please use the temporary accounts provided to you. 
In that case you need to sign a form and we will provide you the credential for the SWAN account.
