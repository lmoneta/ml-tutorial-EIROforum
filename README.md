# Deep Learning Tutorial at the 6th EIROforum school on Instrumentation


This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks for the hands-on tutorial for the Artificial Inteligence session at the 6th EIROforum school on Instrumentation.

See the [agenda page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/777129/timetable/#20190516.detailed)



## Opening the notebooks

The notebooks can be opened and run on SWAN ( swan.cern.ch ), the CERN Jupyter notebook service. Otherwise they can be used directly on your computer if you have all the needed software installed 

### Open Notebooks directly in SWAN

If can open directly the notebook in SWAN by doing this:

*   Click on the following link

[![SWAN](http://swanserver.web.cern.ch/swanserver/images/badge_swan_white_150.png)](https://cern.ch/swanserver/cgi-bin/go?projurl=https://github.com/lmoneta/ml-tutorial-EIROforum ){:target="_blank"}

*  When starting SWAN configure its environment using possibly the **95a python3** software stuck. For the rest you can use the default values.

*  From the Project page click on the ``+`` button in the top right

*  Enter the URL for the github

```
https://github.com/lmoneta/ml-tutorial-EIROforum
```

*  Open the ``ml-tutorial-EIROforum project``.

Now the notebook will be visible in your SWAN project area and you can start using them 

### Download notebooks from github

Otherwise you can do download the notebooks directly from the github repository. 

*  Open a Terminal 
*  Clone your repository 
```
git clone  https://github.com/lmoneta/ml-tutorial-EIROforum
```
* The notebooks will be in the directory *ml-tutorial-EIROforum* 

You can do this also directly in SWAN using its Terminal window. In this case the notebooks will be downloaded in your cernbox. 

## Swan and Jupyter notebooks quick start ##

If you have never used jupyter notebooks, you can find some quickstart information at the following links [What is a jupyter notebook?](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.ipynb), [Notebook Basics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb),  [Running Code](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jupyter/notebook/blob/master/docs/source/examples/Notebook/Running%20Code.ipynb).

For information on using SWAN, see the SWAN website: https://swan.web.cern.ch
In a nutshell, "SWAN (Service for Web based ANalysis) is a platform to perform interactive data analysis in the cloud". It gives you access to the LCG software stacks and to your CERNBOX files.


* You need to have an active **CERNBOX** to use swan (https://cernbox.cern.ch/). If you don't have a CERN account, please use the temporary accounts provided to you. 
In that case you need to sign a form and we will provide you the credential for the SWAN account.
